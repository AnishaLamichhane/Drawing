Challenge
1. One of the best ways to learn is to write your own code as often as possible, so here are three ways you should try extending this app to make sure you fully   understand what’s going on.

2. Create an Arrow shape made from a rectangle and a triangle – having it point straight up is fine.
 Make the line thickness of your Arrow shape animatable.
3. Create a ColorCyclingRectangle shape that is the rectangular cousin of ColorCyclingCircle, allowing us to control the position of the gradient using a property.
